- Create command to list and select layouts like ^a" for windows,
  which would create single region and run wrapper inside, then allow
  j/k movement and enter to select

- Map window list button to only display region windows

- Recover from exits automatically by examining screen -X output and/or
  error codes

- Add window title support

- Create command to bind window to current region (e.g. using tab or
  window select)

- Combine layout build stuff when possible

- Better documentation (man page perhaps...)

- Support region resizing when moving between layouts with more accurate
  edge detection

- Process indirectly supported commands by passing through exactly

- Allow windows to be shared between regions

- Automatically set copy margins when in remote window

- Allow region naming and switch regions like window naming

- Allow layout naming and switch layouts like window naming

- Allow layouts within a single region (so going to next window would go
  to a split region)
