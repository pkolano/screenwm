INSTALL
=======

1.  Install GNU Screen 4.2.0 or above from native package manager or:

        http://www.gnu.org/software/screen


2.  Copy screenwmrc to ~/.screenwmrc and edit it to your liking

    The example screenwmrc shows all Screenwm options.  The general 
    philosophy was to make the layout-related key bindings be the
    capitalized version of the window-related key bindings as follows:
    
        Command         Window      Layout
        =======         ======      ======
        kill               e           E
        next               n           N
        other              o           O
        previous           p           P
        redisplay          r           R
        screen             c           C
        select 0           0           )
        select 1           1           !
        select 2           2           @
        select 3           3           #
        select 4           4           $
        select 5           5           %
        select 6           6           ^
        select 7           7           &
        select 8           8           *
        select 9           9           (

    Bindings were kept as close as possible to the default Screen
    bindings with the following exceptions:
    
        Key         Screen          Screenwm
        ===         ======          ========
         *          displays        layout_select 8
         C          clear           layout_screen
         h          hardcopy        left
         k          kill            up
        ^k          kill            up
         l          redisplay       right
        ^l          redisplay       right
         m          lastmsg         window_meta
        ^m          lastmsg         window_meta
         M          monitor         window_nometa
         N          number          layout_next
         r          wrap            redisplay
        ^r          wrap            redisplay

    The default screenwmrc disables caption strings, dynamic window
    titles (required), status bar, and region separators.


3.  Copy screenwm to a directory in your $PATH


4.  Edit your ~/.screenrc file

    To enable Screenwm, the following line must be added:

        eval screen "exec screenwm init"

    Note that you must always use "exec screenwm cmd" instead of just
    "cmd" in your initialization files for the commands denoted with
    an asterisk in the "README" document and only after you have
    performed "exec screenwm init".

    Also note that Screenwm does not currently support user-defined
    window titles (i.e. "screen -t <title>", "title <title>", etc.) as
    titles are used to select and manipulate windows.  Such support is
    possible, but has not yet been implemented.

    Sample ~/.screenrc:

        defscrollback 10000
        defshell /bin/bash
        defutf8 on
        startup_message off
        eval screen "exec screenwm init"
        bind > eval writebuf "exec sh -c 'xsel -bi </tmp/screen-exchange'"
        bind < eval "exec sh -c 'xsel -bno >/tmp/screen-exchange; screen -X
        readbuf'"
        bind } eval writebuf "exec sh -c 'pbcopy </tmp/screen-exchange'"
        bind { eval writebuf "exec sh -c 'pbpaste >/tmp/screen-exchange; screen -X readbuf'"


5.  Repeat the above steps for any remote hosts that will run Screen

    Screenwm can only forward commands to remote Screen sessions
    running with the Screenwm extension.
